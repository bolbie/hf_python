This git repository is dedicated to working with the book "Head First. Python. 2nd Edition" in Russian Localization.

!!!All comments, commits and files (including answers from the authors) are in English!!!

If you only want to compare your code with the authors, then download the "stock files" folder, which contains all the possible files from the book. In case you want to check my versions you need to change the branch to the chapter you need. In my case, I allocated each chapter its own branch and made all the changes there, except for chapters "11 3/4", which was merged with chapter 11 as a continuation.

Also, "homework" on handling exceptions in the final version of the program at the very end of the book was not done.

You can always offer your version, corrections (especially regarding my English), etc.

I hope this information helps you. Enjoy and learn!
